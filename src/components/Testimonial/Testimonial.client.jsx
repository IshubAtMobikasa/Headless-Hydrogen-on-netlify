The AHA face wash and the moisturizer is fabulous. The best part of shopping from Re'equil is that they have products based on the issues and their recommendations are so right. For me it's the best brand currently in India!",

I am someone who was not confident to use moisturizer & sunscreen because they are way too sticky for my way too oily face. Also, I am someone who has used a lot of brands to see what works for me and I stopped here. I stopped here to never go back.",
